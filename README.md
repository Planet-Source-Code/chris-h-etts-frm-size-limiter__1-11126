## Etts Frm SiZe Limiter


</div>

### Description

Ok I didnt CREATE this but I did OPTIMIZE it and make it into a COMPLETE control, the gentelmen that made it slips my mind but it was like yesterday i think, anways using the VB accelerator ssubtmr.dll and this control allows you to LIMIT the form size of as MANY forms as you want in a single project. Its quite nice, give it a try! PLEASE VOTE! :O)

UPDATED....... No Need for SSubTmr6.DLL I decided it would be ALOT easier for Newer guys to use this if they didnt have to worry about distributing a DLL so... I just sorta built the DLL Code into the Control.... ENJOY!!
